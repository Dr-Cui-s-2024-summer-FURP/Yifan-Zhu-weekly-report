## Reason for not attending the meeting
My family lives not very close to the school, and I have just returned from the UK, so it is not very convenient to rush from home to the school for meetings. But I'll try to keep up with the progress and complete the weekly report.

## Future Plans

1. **Continue completing the Pose-CNN build**
    - Try rebuilding a Linux environment via vmware, updating NVIDIA drivers as well as Windows versions, these may be the issues that cause the version to be inappropriate.
