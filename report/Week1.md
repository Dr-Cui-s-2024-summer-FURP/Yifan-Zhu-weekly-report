# Week 1 Study Summary

## Study Content

1. **Understood the roles and definitions of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers**

2. **Learned the structural composition of convolutional neural networks**

3. **Gained a preliminary understanding of how convolutional neural networks work**
    - Including convolution operations, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers

## Study Difficulties

1. **Have not yet practiced**
    - The current study content is primarily theoretical, and practical experiments and validations have not yet been conducted.

2. **No clear understanding of how CNNs work**
    - Understanding of the specific working mechanism of convolutional neural networks and their practical applications needs further strengthening.

## Future Plans

1. **Continue completing the CNN course**
    - Further deepen the study of convolutional neural networks, understanding their detailed workings and various variants.

2. **Complete the installation of the environment and tools outside of CNN**
    - Install and configure the development environment and tools used for CNN.
